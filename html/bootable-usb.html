    <h3>Format a drive to boot an ISO using MacOS CLI</h3>

    <p>Insert your USB stick into the mac and open Terminal. Wait a second, then run <code>diskutil list</code></p>

    <p>You'll see a list of all disks on your machine. Your USB stick will proabably be the last one. It's name will be
        something like <code>/dev/diskN</code> where "N" is an integer.</p>

    <p>Run <code>diskutil eraseDisk FAT32 NAME /dev/diskN</code></p>

    <p>"NAME" can be anything but it must be all capital letters. This will erase the contents of your disk and reformat
        it to MS-DOS FAT 32, which is the format you want.</p>

    <p>Run <code>diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN</code></p>

    <p>This will unmount your disk. Otherwise, when you try to write to it you will get a resource busy error.</p>

    <p>Read the section below, then run <code>sudo dd bs=1M if=/path/to/your/linux.iso of=/dev/rdiskN</code></p>

    <p>Things to note:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><code>dd</code> is sometimes called "disk destroyer" because it sends the raw bytes of the file to the
                disk selected. Make sure you select the correct disk, or else you could end up destroying one of your
                drives, haha!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>bs=1M</code> defines the transfer rate. Sometimes you will get an error saying illegal numeric
                value. Just change it to 1m as opposed to 1M. It has to be capital or lowercase depending on whether
                you're using mac or linux and it's hard to keep it straight</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>if</code> and <code>of</code> stand for input-file and output-file respectively
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>the "r" in <code>rdiskN</code> stands for raw and makes the process go faster, but you don't need it, and
                it could just as well be <code>/dev/diskN</code></p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The computer will produce no visual output as it formats the file. You just
        have to wait. You can press ctrl-t though if you want an update. When it's done writing to the USB, your prompt
        will return and a window will pop up saying that the USB is unreadable by your computer. This is okay. You can
        choose to eject it from this pop up, or choose ignore and eject it from the command line by running <code>diskutil
        eject /dev/diskN</code></p>

    <p>That's it!</p>
